#  Progressive Web Apps

## Overview

* This application makes use of Node.js / Express.js,MONGODB and concepts of Progressive web apps( Indexdb, service workers, cache, web manifest) on the backend and HTML/CSS on the front end. This budget tracker application is designed to work in offline mode.

* The great thing about the application is that the user can add the transactions even when the app is offline. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

* Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
